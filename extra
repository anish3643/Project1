    <h3>1.<a href="calculation.html"> Feasibility Study:</a></h3>
    Assess the availability of suitable organic feedstock (e.g., animal dung, crop residues, kitchen waste) for the biogas plant.
    Evaluate the energy requirements and potential uses for the generated biogas.
    Determine the size of the plant based on the available feedstock and energy demand.
    <h3>2.<a href="siteselection.html"> Site Selection:</a></h3>
    Choose a well-drained location with proper sunlight exposure for optimal bacterial activity.
    Ensure the site is easily accessible for feedstock delivery and maintenance.
    <h3>3. Design and Component Selection:</h3>
    Decide on the size of the digester based on the feedstock quantity and energy needs.
    Plan the dimensions of the digester and gas holder dome.
    Choose suitable construction materials, such as bricks, concrete, or ferrocement.
    <h3>4. <a href="construction.html">Construction:</a></h3>
    Excavate the pit for the digester and the foundation for the gas holder.
    Build the digester structure using selected construction materials. Ensure the walls are sturdy and airtight to prevent gas leakage.
    Construct the gas holder dome with proper reinforcement and sealing.
    <h3>5. Gas Outlet and Distribution:</h3>
    Install a gas outlet pipe connecting the digester to the gas holder.
    Incorporate a gas distribution system to transfer the biogas to the point of utilization.
    <h3>6. Inlet and Outlet Arrangements:</h3>
    Create a feedstock inlet for adding organic waste to the digester.
    Design an outlet for removing digested material (digestate) from the digester for use as fertilizer.
    <h3>7. Mixing System (Optional):</h3>
    If desired, install a mixing system to promote uniform mixing of feedstock and slurry inside the digester.
    <h3>8. Sealing and Curing:</h3>
    Seal all joints and connections properly to prevent gas leakage.
    Allow the construction materials to cure and set before initiating the digestion process.
    <h3>9. Inoculation and Start-Up:</h3>
    Inoculate the digester with a small amount of active slurry from an existing biogas plant to introduce the necessary bacteria.
    Gradually introduce feedstock to the digester, increasing the quantity over time.
    <h3>10. Digestion and Gas Production:</h3>
    - As the organic matter breaks down, biogas will be produced. The gas holder dome will rise to accommodate the gas.
    <h3>11. Monitoring and Maintenance:</h3>
    - Regularly monitor the gas production, gas pressure, and temperature.
    - Perform maintenance tasks such as cleaning, slurry removal, and checking for leaks.
    <h3>12. Gas Utilization:</h3>
    - Connect the gas outlet to a biogas stove, heater, or generator for energy utilization.
    - Ensure proper ventilation and safety measures to prevent gas buildup.
    <h3>13. Digestate Utilization:</h3>
    - Use the digested material (digestate) as a nutrient-rich fertilizer for agricultural purposes.
    <h3>14. Training and Education:</h3>
    - Provide training to operators and users on the proper operation, maintenance, and safety procedures.
    <h3>15. Regulatory Compliance:</h3>
    - Ensure compliance with local regulations, safety standards, and permits related to biogas plant operation.
    <h3>16. Documentation and Record Keeping:</h3>
    - Maintain records of feedstock quantity, gas production, and maintenance activities for future reference.
    Setting up a fixed dome biogas plant requires a combination of construction skills, knowledge of anaerobic digestion processes, and safety precautions. Collaborating with experts in biogas technology and renewable energy can help ensure a successful setup and operation.</p>
